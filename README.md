# DUMB

Dont Underestimate My Bongos, a fast ransomware proof of concept.

## How do I test it?
Create a folder in My Documents with the name 'TEST' and throw any files you don't like in there; homework, bills, whatever. Compile and run the program and your files will be encrypted using an XOR pad generated via the ISAAC CSPRNG.

Seriously throw whatever you want in there DUMB uses streams so it should be able to handle files larger than 4GB, I have no idea how long it would take.

## How do I report a problem?
Trick question, I don't care about your problems.
